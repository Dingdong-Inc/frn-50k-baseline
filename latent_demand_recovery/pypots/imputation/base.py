    Parameters
    ----------
    device :
        The device for the model to run on. It can be a string, a :class:`torch.device` object, or a list of them.
        If not given, will try to use CUDA devices first (will use the default CUDA device if there are multiple),
        then CPUs, considering CUDA and CPU are so far the main devices for people to train ML models.
        If given a list of devices, e.g. ['cuda:0', 'cuda:1'], or [torch.device('cuda:0'), torch.device('cuda:1')] , the
        model will be parallely trained on the multiple devices (so far only support parallel training on CUDA devices).
        Other devices like Google TPU and Apple Silicon accelerator MPS may be added in the future.

    saving_path :
        The path for automatically saving model checkpoints and tensorboard files (i.e. loss values recorded during
        training into a tensorboard file). Will not save if not given.

    model_saving_strategy :
        The strategy to save model checkpoints. It has to be one of [None, "best", "better", "all"].
        No model will be saved when it is set as None.
        The "best" strategy will only automatically save the best model after the training finished.
        The "better" strategy will automatically save the model during training whenever the model performs
        better than in previous epochs.
        The "all" strategy will save every model after each epoch training.

    Parameters
    ----------

        Size of the batch input into the model for one step.

    epochs :
        Training epochs, i.e. the maximum rounds of the model to be trained with.

    patience :
        Number of epochs the training procedure will keep if loss doesn't decrease.
        Once exceeding the number, the training will stop.
        Must be smaller than or equal to the value of ``epochs``.

    num_workers :
        The number of subprocesses to use for data loading.
        `0` means data loading will be in the main process, i.e. there won't be subprocesses.

    Notes
    -----
    Optimizers are necessary for training deep-learning neural networks, but we don't put  a parameter ``optimizer``
    here because some models (e.g. GANs) need more than one optimizer (e.g. one for generator, one for discriminator),
    and ``optimizer`` is ambiguous for them. Therefore, we leave optimizers as parameters for concrete model
    implementations, and you can pass any number of optimizers to your model when implementing it,
    :class:`pypots.clustering.crli.CRLI` for example.
